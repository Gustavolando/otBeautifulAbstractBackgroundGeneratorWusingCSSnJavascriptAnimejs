## Abstract background with clouds and GBM logo

This is a pretty nice and simple animated effect using Anime.js lib.

I practiced a few CSS pseudo-classes and, manipulate scales and translations using the Anime.js library.

Elegant and dynamic HTML, CSS & JS code.

I created this new branch to explore how background will look with different shapes and add a company logo.  In this case an IT company offering cloud services.

I used the company logo's color for the different colors of clouds.

This is under-progress project.

Pending:
  - Add css vars and organize other constants.
  - Add shadows on clouds
